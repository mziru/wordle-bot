# wordle-bot

A quick project to make some improvements to a Wordle-solving script developed by Yotam Gafni (https://towardsdatascience.com/automatic-wordle-solving-a305954b746e).

- Added browser control and full automation on the New York times Wordle site using Selenium WebDriver. 
- Optimized input data to reduce runtimes and the average number of guesses to reach the correct solution. 

Simply run main.py on a Windows system with Chrome installed, then sit back and watch the bot solve today's Wordle!:
